The project outline you've shared for "Data Ingestion and Preparation" in the Truck Delay Prediction pipeline provides a detailed step-by-step framework for handling data ingestion, exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, and preparation for model building. The tasks include setting up databases, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), cleaning and transforming the data, and integrating with a feature store.

Here is a summarized breakdown of the key sections, along with clarifications and actionable steps for the pipeline:

---

### 1. **Data Ingestion Approach**  
   **Goal:** Import data into the pipeline for further analysis.  
   - **Actions:**
     - Upload CSV files (truck delay data) to GitHub.
     - Set up a PostgreSQL or MySQL server (locally, with plans to migrate to AWS RDS).
     - Create the `Truck_delays` database, defining individual tables for each CSV file (drivers, trucks, routes, etc.).
     - Develop a data ingestion module that automates loading the data from GitHub into the SQL tables.

---

### 2. **Data Exploration**  
   **Goal:** Perform basic checks and visualize the data to understand trends.  
   - **Actions:**
     - **Fetch data** from the tables into Pandas DataFrames.
     - Basic descriptive statistics (e.g., `info()`, `describe()`).
     - Convert date columns to `datetime` type.
     - Generate visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, box plots).
     - Summarize observations for each DataFrame (Drivers, Trucks, Routes, Traffic).

   **Specific Analysis:**
   - **Drivers:** Visualize numeric features (e.g., histogram of age, ratings) and identify gender-based ratings.
   - **Trucks:** Detect low-mileage trucks and explore truck age distribution.
   - **Routes & Traffic:** Plot histograms for key variables and categorize hours into time periods (e.g., Early Morning).

---

### 3. **Data Cleaning**  
   **Goal:** Ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis.
   - **Actions:**
     - Identify and handle missing data (null values).
     - Detect and handle outliers using appropriate techniques (e.g., IQR, Z-scores).

---

### 4. **Feature Store Integration**  
   **Goal:** Prepare features for model building and analysis using Hopsworks feature store.  
   - **Actions:**
     - For each DataFrame, create a new `event_time` column with a standardized datetime (e.g., `pd.to_datetime('2024-09-19')`).
     - Define feature groups for each dataset (drivers, trucks, etc.) with descriptions and insert data into Hopsworks.
     - Enable statistics and compute histograms and correlations for insights.

---

### 5. **Data Preparation**  
   **Goal:** Transform and prepare the data for model building.  
   - **Actions:**
     - Drop duplicate records based on key features (e.g., `weather`: [city_id, date, hour], `trucks`: [truck_id]).
     - Drop unnecessary columns (e.g., weather: `chanceofrain`, `chanceoffog`, etc.).
     - Perform feature engineering:
       - **Schedule Data:** Merge schedule and route weather data.
       - Generate new datetime columns, create date ranges, and aggregate data for merging with weather and traffic.
       - **Traffic & Weather:** Merge weather, traffic, and truck data, handling hourly data for detailed analysis.
       - Apply custom functions for aggregating variables (e.g., accidents).

---

### 6. **Final DataFrame and Feature Engineering**  
   **Goal:** Create the final merged dataset with features ready for model training.
   - **Actions:**
     - Merge schedule, weather, traffic, and truck data into a single DataFrame.
     - Calculate additional features such as nighttime involvement (using `has_midnight` function).
     - Create descriptions for the final features in the dataset.

---

### Example Features in Final DataFrame:

- `unique_id`: Unique identifier for each record.
- `truck_id`: Unique identifier for the truck.
- `route_id`: Unique identifier for the route.
- `departure_date`: Datetime when the truck departed.
- `estimated_arrival`: Estimated arrival datetime.
- `delay`: Binary variable indicating if the truck was delayed (0 for on-time, 1 for delayed).
- Weather-related features: `route_avg_temp`, `route_avg_humidity`, `route_description`, etc.
- `is_midnight`: Indicator of nighttime involvement between departure and arrival.

---

### Conclusion

This structured approach offers a comprehensive plan for ingesting, analyzing, cleaning, and preparing data for truck delay prediction. The focus on merging various datasets (weather, traffic, schedules) ensures that the final dataset will contain all relevant features for accurate model predictions. Feature engineering steps such as handling time ranges, weather conditions, and accident probabilities are key to improving model performance.

This first phase lays a solid foundation for the next stages of model building and deployment.
